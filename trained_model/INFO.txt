NeTab Trained Models Directory
===============================

This directory stores your trained AI models and checkpoints.

What Gets Saved Here:
--------------------
After running training_stage.py, you'll find:

- best_model.pt: Best performing model during training
- final_model.pt: Model state at training completion
- checkpoint_epoch_*.pt: Periodic training checkpoints
- Model tokenizer files (*_tokenizer/)

Usage:
------
These models are used by generation_stage.py to create synthetic data.
Load models using NetworkTrafficModel.load_model("path/to/model.pt")
